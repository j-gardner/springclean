Author: [John Gardner](http://arconixpc.com)

### Requirements

SpringClean uses the Genesis Framework from [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com)

### Theme Notes

The SpringClean theme was designed with simplicity in mind. There is a single widget area in the header for a menu.

All the icons are generated using [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
